                        <p>In 2015 the Chegg UX research department spoke to over 700 students to try to make college a better experience. We also collected data from over 5000 survey responses. The hard work of our research team has led to a more streamlined process for book buying, accessing tutors, and getting answers to questions that otherwise stump students.
